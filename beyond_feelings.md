## Preface

When the first edition of this book appeared in 1975, the dominant intel- lectual focus was still subjectivity, feelings. That focus, the legacy of the 1960s, was originally a necessary reaction to the rationalism and behav- iorism that preceded it. It declared, in effect: “People are not robots. They are more than the sum total of their physiology. They have hopes, dreams, emotions. No two humans are alike—each has a special perspec- tive, a unique way of perceiving the world. And any view of humanity that ignores this subjective side is a distortion.”
Yet, despite its value, the focus on feelings went too far. Like many other movements, what began as a reaction against an extreme view became an extreme view itself. The result of that extremism was the neg- lect of thinking. This book was designed to answer that neglect. The introduction to the first edition explained its rationale as follows:
>The emphasis on subjectivity served to correct a dangerous oversimplifi- cation. But it is the kind of reaction that cannot be sustained for long without causing an even worse situation—the neglect of thinking. Worse for two reasons. First, because we live in an age of manipulation. Armies of hucksters and demagogues stand ready with the rich resources of psy- chology to play upon our emotions and subconscious needs to persuade us that superficial is profound, harmful is beneficial, evil is virtuous. And feelings are especially vulnerable to such manipulation.
>Secondly, because in virtually every important area of modern life— law, medicine, government, education, science, business, and community affairs—we are beset with serious problems and complex issues that demand careful gathering and weighing of facts and informed opinions, thoughtful consideration of various conclusions or actions, and judi- cious selection of the best conclusion or most appropriate action. . . .
>[Today’s college student] has been conditioned not to undervalue subjectivity, but to overvalue it. And so he does not need to have his feel- ings indulged. Rather, he needs to be taught how to sort out his feelings, decide to what extent they have been shaped by external influences, and evaluate them carefully when they conflict among themselves or with the feelings of others. In short, he needs to be taught to think critically.
>There is an unfortunate tendency among many to view feeling and thought as mutually exclusive, to force a choice between them. If we focus on one, then in their view we must reject the other. But this is mis- taken. Feeling and thought are perfectly complementary. Feeling, being more spontaneous, is an excellent beginning to the development of con- clusions. And thought, being more deliberate, provides a way to identify the best and most appropriate feeling. Both are natural.
>Thinking, however, is less automatic than feeling. To do it well demands a systematic approach and guided practice.
